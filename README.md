## Special thanks to

* [Jannis Weis](https://github.com/weisJ) for putting so much effort and time into the development of [darklaf](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf), a theme-based swing look and feel with many additional features that make it really pleasant to create some swing UIs again.
* The contributors and creators of [jSerialComm](https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm), who created a great Java library for platform independent access to serial ports.
